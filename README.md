## 👋 Hello, my username is PCPPTech/yikebones! 👋
## 👨‍💻 I really enjoy coding and building my own applications and several other types of mini-projects! 👨‍💻
- I mostly use either `C++` or `Python`, however I've been more into `C++` lately, I like its complexity.
- I am trying to learn `web development`, but with the constant advancement of *AI*, I am half convinced that in 10 years at least, web development will be automated. Feel free to change my mind.
## ☕ My favorite thing is coding at night with a cup of coffee ^^ ☕ 
## 😴 My dream is to work at Microsoft oneday! 😴

I am very clear with the fact that A.I. *MIGHT* take over the programming and coding industry alltogether, so for now, all this coding is just a hobby, even though i wanna make it more than that.
